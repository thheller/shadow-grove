;; ideally would like to use pathom but currently that carries too much overhead
;; and is over 10x slower for small simple queries. assuming that a page
;; has 50 small queries the difference of 0.4ms vs 8.5ms per query is huge
;; also has quite excessive code size (partly because of spec)

;; pathom of course has a bajillion more features, just need to find a way
;; to make it more performant for the grove use-cases of many small queries
;; vs one large query that is composed from the root like fulcro does
;; I might have just configured or used it wrong

;; as long as everything is EQL it should be fine and easy to switch later

;; unions are currently not supported. not sure where you'd ever need them.
;; seems like it's only useful if you are forced to build one big query
;; like in om/fulcro systems which is the first thing I dropped since it felt
;; way too restrictive to use for me and that concept never "clicked".

;; IMHO in the presence of suspense it no longer makes sense to build large queries
;; since you may want to render parts early when you can

(defmulti attr
  "Define 'computed attributes'. The attribute is the dispatch-fn of the method.
   The return of this function will be included in query results for that
   attribute. *Must not return lazy seq.*

   The methods are called with the following args:
   1. `env` - component env.
   2. `db` - the db map.
   3. `current` - the entity which is the root of the query. For `query-ident`
      this is the entity corresponding to the ident, for `query-root` it is the
      whole db map.
   4. `query-part` â€“ the dispatch-fn of the method, i.e. an EQL attribute.
   5. `params` - optional parameters specified with EQL attributes.

   Called when building query results for each EQL attribute. See [[::default]].
   Idents accessed within the method will be 'observed': the query will re-run
   if said idents are modified.   
   
   ---   
   Example:
   
   ```clojure
   ;; in a component
   (bind query-result
     (sg/query-ident ident [::foo '(::bar {:test 1})]))

   ;; elsewhere
   (defmethod attr ::foo
     [env db current query-part params]
     ;; the ::default impl
     (get current query-part :db/undefined))

   ;; {:test 1} available in `params` for
   (defmethod attr ::bar
     [_ _ _ _ params])
   
   ;; another example
   (defmethod eql/attr ::m/num-active
     [env db current _ params]
     (->> (db/all-of db ::m/todo)
         (remove ::m/completed?)
